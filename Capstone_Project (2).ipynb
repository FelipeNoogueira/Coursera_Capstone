    "Opening a food establishment requires great investment of both time and money, specially in Brazil, which is famous for its long bureaucratic processes for registering a new business. Therefore, it is prudent and expected of any entrepreneur to study its market and to search for its best opportunities before making a decision. This report was developed specially for providing starting entrepreneurs from Belo Horizonte with a reliable and data-driven segmentation of the city neighborhoods in groups formed by similar representativeness of cuisine categories among its food venues. This analysis is meant to deliver insights on where a particular type of food establishment would have greater chances of acceptance by the public, and also to reveal neighborhoods with untapped potential for particular cuisines.

Afterwards, geopy.geocoder module in Python will be used to get each neighborhood's coordinates using their names. These coordinates will be used to make Foursquare requests that will search for food venues within a specified radius for each neighborhood. Finally, all the data will be gathered in a Pandas dataframe and be ready for manipulation and further analysis. "
